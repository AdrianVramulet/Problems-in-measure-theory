\begin{problem} Let $(\Omega, \cF, \mu)$ be a measure space.
Let $(f_n)_{n\in\bbN}$ be a sequence of measurable functions such that converges pointwise a.e. to $f$ and for all $n\in\bbN$ $|f_n| \leq g$, where $g$ is integrable.
 Prove that for any $\varepsilon > 0$ there exists $E\in\cF$ s.t. $\mu(E) < \varepsilon$ and $f_n \to f$ uniformly on $E^c$.

\begin{problem} Let $(\Omega, \cF, \mu)$ be a $\sigma$-finite measure space.
Suppose that $(f_n)_{n\in\bbN}$ is a sequence of measurable functions such that converges pointwise a.e. to $f$.
Show that there exists a sequence of measurable sets $(A_k)$, such that $\mu \left( \bigcap_k A_k^c \right) = 0$ and such that for any $k\in\bbN$ $(f_n)$ converges uniformly to $f$ on $A_k$.

\begin{problem} Let $(\Omega, \cF, \mu)$ be a finite measure space. Use Egorov's theorem (and not Dominated convergence) to show the following \emph{bounded convergence} theorem. 
Suppose that $(f_n)_{n\in\bbN}$ is a sequence of measurable functions such that converges pointwise a.e. to $f$, and assume that there is $M>0$ such that $|f_n|\leq M$ for all $n\in \bbN$. Show that 
\begin{equation*}
    \int_\Omega|f_n-f|\,\De \mu \to 0.
\end{equation*}
